Authentication is the act of proving that someone is who they say they are, such as the identity of a user in an application.

In this tutorial, we’ll learn how to implement authentication in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) apps using [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/), which is a library specifically designed to handle authentication solutions in Next.js apps.

According to the [documentation](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/introduction), “NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for Next.js applications. It is designed from the ground up to support Next.js and [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/).”

## Prerequisites for building an authentication API for Next.js

To follow along with this tutorial, you’ll need the following:

- A basic understanding of [React](https://reactjs.org)
- A basic understanding of [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) or any other database
- A basic understanding of how authentication works

Nice-to-haves:

- Prior experience with the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) framework

## Building an authentication API with NextAuth.js

In this tutorial, we are going to build a basic authentication API using the built-in Next.js API routes. The authentication will consist of a passwordless email sign-in, open authentication with Google. Then we’ll look into securing API endpoints and protected pages.

All the code written in this tutorial is available on this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/francisudeji/authentication-for-nextjs-serverless).

### Scaffolding the application

Next.js has a handy CLI we can use to generate a starter project. To begin, install the CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g create-next-app
```

Now, create a new Next.js app:

```bash
create-next-app next-authentication
```

When prompted to choose a template, choose the default starter app option and hit enter to continue.

Now change the directory to the newly created project folder:

```bash
cd next-authentication
```

Then, start the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This should start the development server at http://localhost:3000.

### Creating environment variables in Next.js

Because we are going to work with several credentials, we need to hide them. Create a new file at the root of the project folder called `.env.local` and paste in this snippet:

```bash
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Notice that this is the same as the URL of our development server. If you have yours running on another port, then replace it. We’ll populate this file as we progress.

### Setting up NextAuth.js

In this step, we are going to install the `next-auth` dependency and use API routes. API routes in Next.js allow us to create API endpoints without creating a custom server.

API routes run on one server during development, and when deployed, are deployed as sever-less functions that run independently of each other. Learn more about API routes in the [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction).

### Installing the `next-auth` dependency

Install `next-auth` by running the snippet below:

```bash
yarn add next-auth
```

### Creating a dynamic API route

Create a new file in called `[…nextauth].js` in `pages/api/auth` and paste this snippet in the newly created file:

```jsx
// pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js
import NextAuth from "next-auth";

const options = {
  site: process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL,
};

export default (req, res) => NextAuth(req, res, options);
```

Note how we used the spread operator in the name of the dynamic API route wrapped in square brackets. That’s because behind the scenes, all requests made to `/api/auth/*` (sign-in, callback, sign-out, etc.), will automatically be handed by NextAuth.js.

The `site` option is used by NextAuth.js as a base URL to work with, so all redirects and callback URLs will use http://localhost:3000 as their base URL. In production, for example, this should be replaced with the base URL of your website.

### Using the NextAuth.js `<Provider>`

According to the [documentation](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client):

> Using the supplied React `<Provider>` allows instances of `useSession()` to share the session object across components, by using [**React Context**](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) under the hood. This improves performance, reduces network calls and avoids page flicker when rendering. It is highly recommended and can be easily added to all pages in Next.js apps by using `pages/_app.js`.

Now open `pages/_app.js` and replace it with this snippet:

```jsx
// pages/_app.js
import { Provider } from "next-auth/client";

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <Provider session={pageProps.session}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </Provider>
  );
}
```

In this code, we wrapped our application with the `Provider` component from NextAuth.js and passed in the session page prop. This is to avoid checking the session twice on pages that support both server and client-side rendering.

### Signing in with an email address

For email sign-in to work, we’ll need a database to store information about the user. As mentioned earlier, we’ll be using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as the database of choice, but feel free to use any other one.

<blockquote>
  Note: NextAuth.js requires a database if working with email sign-in. However,
  for OAuth, a database is not required.
</blockquote>

### Creating a MongoDB database

Because we’ll be using MongoDB, we can create a database by running the following snippet:

Enter MongoDB shell:

```bash
mongo
```

Create a new database called `nextauth`:

```bash
use nextauth;
```

### Adding database credentials for authentication

Our database connection string should look something like this:

```bash
mongodb://localhost:27017/nextauth
```

Now open the `.env.local` file and add this snippet:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/nextauth
```

The last piece necessary for the database to work is the database driver. Luckily, all we need to do now is install `mongodb` as a dependency:

```bash
yarn add mongodb
```

If you’re using any other database, install the appropriate database driver by following this [link](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/databases).

### Adding the `Providers` to NextAuth.js

NextAuth.js has a concept of providers, which define the services that can be used to sign in, such as email or OAuth.

To begin, import the `Providers` module and replace the options object with the following snippet in the `pages/api/auth/[…nextauth].js`:

```bash
// pages/api/auth/[…nextauth].js
// ...other imports
import Providers from 'next-auth/providers'

const options = {
  site: process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL,
  providers: [
    Providers.Email({
      server: {
        port: 465,
        host: 'smtp.gmail.com',
        secure: true,
        auth: {
          user: process.env.EMAIL_USERNAME,
          pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASSWORD,
        },
        tls: {
          rejectUnauthorized: false,
        },
      },
      from: process.env.EMAIL_FROM,
    })
  ],
  database: process.env.DATABASE_URL
}
```

Let’s break down what these new changes are:

First, we imported the `Providers` module, which gives us access to the different providers that NextAuth.js supports.

Next, we introduced a new `providers` option, which is an array that takes a list of all the providers. For now, we passed the `Email` provider along with some options about our email server.

The email provider accepts either a connection string or a configuration object similarly to using N[odemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/) to take care of sending confirmation emails based on the credentials passed above.

Learn more about [configuring email providers](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/email) here.

> Note: In the above configuration, I used my Gmail account. If you choose to
> use yours, then you might need to [enable less secure
> apps](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en). If not, then
> provide credentials from your email server.

Moving forward, the `database` option takes in the connection string to our database created earlier.

From the snippet above, we referenced a few new variables, so add them by pasting this snippet in `.env.local` file:

```bash
EMAIL_FROM=YOUR NAME <youremail@example.com>
EMAIL_USERNAME=youremail@example.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=yourpassword
```

At this point, we need to restart our server to allow those new environment variables to take effect. Once that’s done, we need to navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/signin` to see the sign-in screen.

It should look like this:

![Email sign-in screen](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_323E60A6CE9C36F141DA66DCD43C4EA8CC196EDE5A8C108F36CF3B191C31A4B1_1599231225035_image.png)

By default, NextAuth.js comes baked with a minimal UI that shows sign-in options based on the authentication providers provided during configuration.

After submitting the form, we should be redirected to a success page and receive an email with a verification token if that's the first sign-in with that email. If not, we’ll receive a sign-in email link.

This is what the success page should look like:

![Email success page](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_323E60A6CE9C36F141DA66DCD43C4EA8CC196EDE5A8C108F36CF3B191C31A4B1_1599231699868_image.png)

Here’s what the verification email should look like.

![Verification email](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_323E60A6CE9C36F141DA66DCD43C4EA8CC196EDE5A8C108F36CF3B191C31A4B1_1599231838049_image.png)

Clicking on the **Sign** **I\*\***n\*\* link should take us to the homepage by default.

In the next section, we’ll look at how to display the current user information. If we take a look at our database now, we’ll see a new entry with information about the signed-in user:

![signed in user](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_323E60A6CE9C36F141DA66DCD43C4EA8CC196EDE5A8C108F36CF3B191C31A4B1_1599232163148_image.png)

### Handling user sessions

In this section, we’re going to use the session data to display information about the current user. It’s worth noting that, by default, NextAuth.js uses database sessions for email sign-in and [JWT](https://jwt.io/) for OAuth.

To enable JWT when using email sign-in, we need to add that option to our API route. To do so, add this snippet to the `options` object:

```js
session: {
  jwt: true,
  maxAge: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 // 30 days
},
```

This option tells NextAuth.js to use JWT for storing user sessions, and that the session should last for 30 days. For more information about the possible options, refer to the [documentation](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options).

Now, to get the session data in our app, we either choose to use the `useSession` hook on the client side or the `getSession` function on the server side.

Next, open `pages/index.js` and replace the current content with this snippet:

```jsx
// pages/index.js
import { signIn, signOut, useSession } from "next-auth/client";

export default function Page() {
  const [session, loading] = useSession();

  if (loading) {
    return <p>Loading...</p>;
  }

  return (
    <>
      {!session && (
        <>
          Not signed in <br />
          <button onClick={signIn}>Sign in</button>
        </>
      )}
      {session && (
        <>
          Signed in as {session.user.email} <br />
          <button onClick={signOut}>Sign out</button>
        </>
      )}
    </>
  );
}
```

In this snippet, we imported a few functions: `signIn`, `signOut`, and `useSession`. The first two, as you might have guessed, are used for signing in a user and signing out a signed-in user.

The `useSession` hook returns a tuple containing the `session` and a `loading` state. We used the loading state to display a loading text and conditionally render a sign-in or sign-out button, as well as user data, depending on whether the user is currently signed in or not.

Here’s a preview of the homepage with and without a signed-in user:

![Unauthenticated user](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_323E60A6CE9C36F141DA66DCD43C4EA8CC196EDE5A8C108F36CF3B191C31A4B1_1599465789192_image.png)

![Authenticated user](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_323E60A6CE9C36F141DA66DCD43C4EA8CC196EDE5A8C108F36CF3B191C31A4B1_1599465859295_image.png)

## Protected routes in Next.js

Now that we have implemented email sign-in, we can use the user session to grant or deny access to any page we want. We also have the option of doing this on the server or on the client side.

### Server-side protection

To take advantage of route protection using SSR, we can use the `getSession` function instead. To begin, create a new file called `dashboard.js` in the `pages` folder and paste the following snippet:

```jsx
// pages/dashboard.js
import { getSession } from "next-auth/client";

export default function Dashboard({ user }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Dashboard</h1>
      <p>Welcome {user.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export async function getServerSideProps(ctx) {
  const session = await getSession(ctx);
  if (!session) {
    ctx.res.writeHead(302, { Location: "/" });
    ctx.res.end();
    return {};
  }

  return {
    props: {
      user: session.user,
    },
  };
}
```

To server render a page in Next.js, we need to export an `async` function called `getServerSideProps`. This function receives a context argument, and by passing the context to the `getSession` function, we get back the session. To learn more about SSR in Next.js, [read the documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getserversideprops-server-side-rendering).

If there’s no session, we simply redirect the user back to the home page, else we return an object with a `user` prop.

Finally, on the `Dashboard` component, we accessed the `user` prop that contains the user data.

### Client-side protection

To begin, create a new file called `profile.js` in the `pages` folder and paste this snippet:

```jsx
// pages/profile.js
import { useSession } from "next-auth/client";
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";

const UnauthenticatedComponent = dynamic(() =>
  import("../components/unauthenticated")
);
const AuthenticatedComponent = dynamic(() =>
  import("../components/authenticated")
);

export default function Profile() {
  const [session, loading] = useSession();

  if (typeof window !== "undefined" && loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;

  if (!session) return <UnauthenticatedComponent />;

  return <AuthenticatedComponent user={session.user} />;
}
```

This is somewhat similar to what we had in the `pages/index.js` file, but this time, we are taking advantage of code-splitting by lazy loading both the `AuthenticatedComponent` and the `UnauthenticatedComponent`.

Here’s a rundown of what this snippet does:

First, we imported the `useSession` hook, then we imported a special function in Next.js called `dynamic`. This function is what enables us to dynamically import any component. Because our app will always be in one of two states — authenticated or unauthenticated — we don’t need to import both components if only one is going to be used at a time.

Next, we destructured the `session` and `loading` state and used the `session` to dynamically render to the DOM.

Finally, we rendered a loading text while NextAuth.js is still loading, and either the `AuthenticatedComponent` or `UnauthenticatedComponent`, depending on if we have a session.

Now, create a new folder called `components` and two files: `authenticated.js` and `unauthenticated.js`.

In `authenticated.js`, paste this snippet:

```jsx
// components/authenticated.js
import { signOut } from "next-auth/client";

export default function Authenticated({ user }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You are authenticated {user.email}</p>
      <button onClick={signOut}>Sign Out</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In the `unauthenticated.js` file, paste this snippet:

```jsx
// components/unauthenticated.js
import { signIn } from "next-auth/client";

export default function Unauthenticated() {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You are not authenticated</p>
      <button onClick={signIn}>Sign In</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In `components/authenticated.js`, we imported the `signOut` function and destructured the `user` prop passed from `pages/profile.js`. We also displayed the user data and sign out button for signing out the user.

In `components/unauthenticated.js`, we displayed a message to the user. When the user clicks on the sign in button, we call the `signIn` function imported above.

### API route protection

We can also extend our authentication service to Next.js’s API routes. It’ll be similar to what we did with server-side rendering and can be useful for allowing API access to only authenticated users.

To start, create a new file called `data.js` in `pages/api` and paste this snippet:

```jsx
// pages/api/data.js
import { getSession } from "next-auth/client";

export default async (req, res) => {
  const session = await getSession({ req });

  if (session) {
    res.status(200).json({
      message: "You can access this content because you are signed in.",
    });
  } else {
    res.status(403).json({
      message:
        "You must be sign in to view the protected content on this page.",
    });
  }
};
```

Any file that exports a default `async` function and is created in the `page/api` folder will automatically be an API route. In this case, this file will be mapped to `http://localhost:3000/api/data`.

In this snippet, we imported the `getSession` function and passed in the request object acquired from our API route.

From there, NextAuth.js takes care of reading the cookies. Finally, we returned a message to the user based on the availability of the session.

To test this, we can create a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/api/data` to get back a response.

## Sign in with OAuth

NextAuth.js has many built-in providers out of the box. Unlike the email provider, we don’t need a database to use them. In this section, we’re going to create an app on Google’s developer console and obtain our client ID and secret.

If you’re already familiar with creating apps on these platforms, then you can skip ahead to the “**Handling page redirects\*\***”\*\* section.

### Sign in with Google

To enable sign in with Google, we need to create a new project on the [developer console](https://console.developers.google.com/), sign in with our Google account, and create a new app by clicking the **NEW PROJECT** button on the modal.

It should look something like this:

![New Google project](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_323E60A6CE9C36F141DA66DCD43C4EA8CC196EDE5A8C108F36CF3B191C31A4B1_1599660295127_image.png)

Next, we need to give our project a name and click the **CREATE** button:

![Project name](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_323E60A6CE9C36F141DA66DCD43C4EA8CC196EDE5A8C108F36CF3B191C31A4B1_1599660442804_image.png)

Next, click on the **CONFIGURE CONSENT SCREEN** button**:**

![Configure consent screen](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_323E60A6CE9C36F141DA66DCD43C4EA8CC196EDE5A8C108F36CF3B191C31A4B1_1599660700837_image.png)

Then, check the **External** checkbox, and then click the **CREATE** button. Here’s the screen:

![Google OAuth consent screen](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_323E60A6CE9C36F141DA66DCD43C4EA8CC196EDE5A8C108F36CF3B191C31A4B1_1599820597194_image.png)

For the next step, we need to give our app a name. Once that’s done, click the **Save** button.

![Create the app name](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_323E60A6CE9C36F141DA66DCD43C4EA8CC196EDE5A8C108F36CF3B191C31A4B1_1599839324933_image.png)

Now we need to go back to the credentials page, click on the **CREATE CREDENTIALS** drop-down button, and choose **OAuth client ID:**

![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_323E60A6CE9C36F141DA66DCD43C4EA8CC196EDE5A8C108F36CF3B191C31A4B1_1599840083791_image.png)

Select **Web Application** as the application type:

![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_323E60A6CE9C36F141DA66DCD43C4EA8CC196EDE5A8C108F36CF3B191C31A4B1_1599840159870_image.png)

Fill in the form like in the screenshot below:

![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_323E60A6CE9C36F141DA66DCD43C4EA8CC196EDE5A8C108F36CF3B191C31A4B1_1599840325847_image.png)

Here, we added our app’s base URL and the callback URL NextAuth.js expects for Google OAuth. Using another service like [GitHub](https://github.com/) would mean we’d need to replace _/callback/google_ with _/callback/github\*\*._ \*\*

After clicking on the **CREATE** button, a modal should pop up with our credentials, like so:

![OAuth credentials](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_323E60A6CE9C36F141DA66DCD43C4EA8CC196EDE5A8C108F36CF3B191C31A4B1_1599840659541_image.png)

All we need to do now is add these as environment variables and register a new provider.

### Adding Google credentials

Open the `.env.local` lo file and paste this snippet:

```jsx
GOOGLE_ID = YOUR_GOOGLE_ID;
GOOGLE_SECRET = YOUR_GOOGLE_SECRET;
```

### Adding a new provider

Open `pages/api/auth/[nextauth].js` file and add this snippet in the `providers` array:

```jsx
Providers.Google({
  clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_ID,
  clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_SECRET,
}),
```

We’ll need to restart our app to see the new changes. After a restart, our sign-in page should now look like this.

![Sign in with Google](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_323E60A6CE9C36F141DA66DCD43C4EA8CC196EDE5A8C108F36CF3B191C31A4B1_1599841584135_image.png)

With this, we should be able to log in with our Google accounts. From here on out, adding a new provider should be as easy as creating an app on the platform, obtaining credentials, and adding it to the list of providers.

## Handling Page Redirects

Next.js provides a way to customize callbacks in our app. One of these callbacks is the redirect callback. This is called any time a user is redirected to a callback, such as sign in and sign out, for example.

But why do we care about this? Well, do you notice how any time we sign in, we get redirected back to the home page? Let’s change that to go to the `/profile` page we created earlier.

To handle this, we’ll need to hook into NextAuth.js’ `callbacks` option and modify only the `redirect` function. Add this snippet to the `options` object in `pages/api/auth/[…nextauth].js`:

```jsx
// ...other options
callbacks: {
    redirect: async (url, _) => {
      if (url === '/api/auth/signin') {
        return Promise.resolve('/profile')
      }
      return Promise.resolve('/api/auth/signin')
    },
},
```

The `redirect` function takes two parameters: `url` and `baseUrl`. But for this example, we don’t care about the second parameter. This function also expects that we return a promise.

Now, check to see that we are currently on the sign-in page. If so, then we need to go to the `/profile` page, otherwise we are sent back to the sign-in page.

## Common issues

Sometimes GitLab OAuth gives a callback error. Make sure that you have enabled the `read_user` and `email` scopes on the [Applications](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/issues/285#issuecomment-646483474) page. Furthermore, make sure that your GitLab config matches [NextAuth’s config](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/issues/285#issuecomment-646483474). This will allow you to successfully enable OAuth for your app. If it still doesn’t work, look at this solution [in this GitHub issue](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/issues/285#issuecomment-646483474).

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to implement email and OAuth authentication using Next.js and NextAuth.js in our application. In the process, we used the session data to protect pages on both the client side and server side. After reading this, hopefully adding authentication in a brand-new or existing Next.js app is now seamless.

NextAuth.js comes baked in with many features not covered in this tutorial. A great next step to take is to add more OAuth providers and customize the design of the sign-in page by following [this guide](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/pages)
