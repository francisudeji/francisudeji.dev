Discriminated unions in TypeScript are a powerful feature that allows developers to model complex data structures with improved type safety and readability. In this guide, we'll dive deep into what discriminated unions are, why they're valuable, and how to leverage them effectively in your TypeScript projects.

## What are Discriminated Unions?

Discriminated unions, also known as tagged unions or algebraic data types, are a TypeScript feature that enables you to create a type composed of several distinct types. These distinct types are unified under a common discriminant property, which differentiates between them.

## Why Use Discriminated Unions?

- **Enhanced Type Safety**: Discriminated unions provide precise type information, making it less likely to encounter runtime errors. The discriminant property acts as a type guard, enabling TypeScript to infer the specific type within the union.

- **Readable Code**: Discriminated unions make your code more self-documenting by explicitly stating the different variants a value can take. This enhances code readability and maintainability.

- **Pattern Matching**: Discriminated unions facilitate pattern matching, enabling you to handle different cases more elegantly and avoiding lengthy chains of if and else statements.

## Creating Discriminated Unions:

To create a discriminated union in TypeScript, follow these steps:

- Define an interface or type for each variant of the union.
- Add a shared property, the discriminant, that will differentiate between the variants.
- Create a type that combines all the individual types using the vertical bar (|) operator.

Here's an example from the typescript official website:

```ts
interface Square {
  kind: "square";
  sideLength: number;
}

interface Circle {
  kind: "circle";
  radius: number;
}

type Shape = Square | Circle;
```

## Pattern Matching with Discriminated Unions:

Pattern matching can be achieved using a switch statement in TypeScript. The discriminant property allows the compiler to infer the specific type within each case block.

```ts
function calculateArea(shape: Shape): number {
  switch (shape.kind) {
    case "square":
      return shape.sideLength * shape.sideLength;
    case "circle":
      return Math.PI * shape.radius * shape.radius;
  }
}
```

In conclusion, discriminated unions are a valuable tool in TypeScript for handling complex data structures with increased type safety and readability. By leveraging pattern matching and precise type information, developers can write more maintainable and error-resistant code. Integrating these concepts into your projects can significantly enhance your coding experience and the quality of your applications.
